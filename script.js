/* LEVEL UP! (optional) 
	1. Function explanations: 
    // validateResult function: To utilize the form correctly, data entered into a text field must be in the correct format and be of a specific kind. For example, elements like the room widthÂ and lengthÂ rollÂ must be written in numbers rather than letters other wise you'll get an error or the Not a Number "NaN" result.

  // calculateCarpetTest function: Checks if a string matches another one. Returning true if it discovers a match and false otherwise, like we have here if we entered the values provided for each room the expected result of '11.00' if it is not '11.00' that means something is wrong.
